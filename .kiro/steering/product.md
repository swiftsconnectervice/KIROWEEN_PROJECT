# FrankenStack: Legacy-to-AI Connector
**Halloween Edition: Resurrecting AS/400 for Modern Agents**

## Mission
Enable AI agents to interact with IBM AS/400 (TN5250) legacy systems 
without replacing them, using MCP protocol as the translation layer.

## Core Use Cases
1. **Claim Resurrection**: Process insurance claims from email → AS/400
2. **Fraud Detection**: Cross-reference AS/400 data with NOAA weather API
3. **Report Necromancy**: Generate Excel reports from terminal queries

## Success Criteria
- MCP server must translate TN5250 screen scraping to JSON
- Agent must reduce claim processing from 45min to &lt;5min
- UI must visualize data flow between legacy and AI systems
