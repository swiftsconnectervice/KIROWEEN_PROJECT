# Why This Project Was Impossible Without Kiro

## Attempt 1: Pure Vibe Coding (Failed)
- Generated 500 lines of spaghetti code
- No separation of concerns
- Could not handle async MCP orchestration

## Attempt 2: Manual Specs (Failed)
- Spent 8 hours writing specs by hand
- Still missed edge cases
- Agent logic was brittle

## Kiro Solution: Hybrid Approach (Success)
- Vibe coding for rapid prototyping (Paso 5)
- Spec-driven for production logic (Paso 3, 6, 9)
- Agent hooks for reliability (Día 3)
- Infrastructure-as-Spec (Día 4)
- Result: 60% less code, 300% more robust
