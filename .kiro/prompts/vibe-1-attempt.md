# Prompt Intent: Generate AS/400 MCP Server
# Status: PLANNED (not executed yet)
# Reason: Need to define mock data schema first

## Known Challenges
- TN5250 protocol is synchronous and blocking
- Need to simulate 2-second delay for realism
- Must handle malformed screen data without crashing

## Risk Mitigation
Will create mock data generator FIRST, then MCP server.
